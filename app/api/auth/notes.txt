 NextAuth is becoming Auth.js in future so look for documentation. Also look documentation for 13.* version documentation for next auth as it use new app router
 Any route with /auth we are going to handler it here
 after creating route.ts we create 2 env variables
 after defining NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET we have to configure a provider
